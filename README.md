# exceptional-outliner

An outlining tool

This app is migrating [this project](https://github.com/reishaleem/exceptional-wiki-back-end) to a MERN stack. It is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance [here](http://ec2-54-162-241-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com/)

Later, describe the design pattern in this. Or add it to the components folder as a readme. Either way, explain what we think constitutes an atom, molecule,
and organism. Page should be obvious. I think the key is molecule and organism is ambigious, but I _tried_ to go with a distinction based on functionality and
how easily it can stand alone. For example, a Navbar is an organism, because it can easily stand alone on its own anywhere. It doesn't _really_ rely on others,
although it does need routes for the buttons. Meanwhile a Login Form, despite being more complex than a Navbar in some ways, is a molecule, because in terms of
the app, I don't think it can stand on its own. It _has_ to be on the login page and nowhere else.

But at the same time I can already see arguments for not doing that...
